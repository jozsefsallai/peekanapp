# Peek-An-App API

**Peek-An-App** is a free-to-use API that you can use to fetch information about
a given application on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

## Google Play Store

Get information about a Google Play Store application. The `appId` needs to be
the string identifier of the application, for example: `app.somus.social`.

```
GET /api/playstore?appId=<appId>
```

## Apple App Store

Get information about an Apple App Store application. The `appId` needs to be
the string identifier of the application, for example: `app.somus.social`.

```
GET /api/appstore?appId=<appId>
```

## Both

Get information for two applications on both stores. The `androidAppId` and
`iOSAppId` need to be the string identifier of the applications and they can be
different.

```
GET /api/all?androidAppId=<androidAppId>&iOSAppId=<iOSAppId>
```

The response looks like this:

```json
{
  "playstore": { ... },
  "appstore": { ... },
  "errors": []
}
```

If either `androidAppId` or `iOSAppId` is omitted, the respective fields in the
response will be `null`.
